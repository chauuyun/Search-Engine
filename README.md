## Data Structures final project  
### Search Engine Implementation  
**Technologies Used**: C++  
- Developed a search engine using C++ (VScode) with a
focus on utilizing the TrieNode data structure. Key
features of the implementation include:  
- **Suffix Search**: Enabled searching for strings with
specific suffixes, allowing for efficient retrieval of
data ending with certain patterns.  
- **Wildcard Search**: Implemented wildcard search
functionality, which permits the use of placeholders
in search queries for flexible data retrieval.  
- **Full Search**: Developed a comprehensive search
feature that allows for the complete scanning of the
dataset to find exact matches.  
- **Prefix Search**: Facilitated searching for strings with
specific prefixes, enabling quick access to data
starting with certain characters.

### How to compile on VScode
- cmd terminal:
1. g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o filename  
2. .\filename [input_folder_path] [query_file_path] [output_file_name]
   For example: .\filename data query.txt output.txt
