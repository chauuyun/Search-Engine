# Search-Engine
## Data Structures final project
### Search Engine Implementation
Technologies Used: C++
Developed a search engine using C++ (VScode) with a
focus on utilizing the TrieNode data structure. Key
features of the implementation include:
Suffix Search: Enabled searching for strings with
specific suffixes, allowing for efficient retrieval of
data ending with certain patterns.
Wildcard Search: Implemented wildcard search
functionality, which permits the use of placeholders
in search queries for flexible data retrieval.
Full Search: Developed a comprehensive search
feature that allows for the complete scanning of the
dataset to find exact matches.
Prefix Search: Facilitated searching for strings with
specific prefixes, enabling quick access to data
starting with certain characters.
